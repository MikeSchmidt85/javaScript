// Concatenating Strings with Plus Operators

//Example

var ourString = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// You can concatenate strings by adding a plus sign inbetween strings or put them together as one string

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";

console.log(ourString)
console.log(myStr)
