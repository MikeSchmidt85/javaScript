//  Compound Assignment with Augmented Multiplication

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

//Only modify code below this line

a = a * 12;
b = 9 * b;
c = c * 7;

// There is an easier way to write this
//Both the lines above and below are the same problem

a *= 12;
b *= 9;
c *= 7;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
